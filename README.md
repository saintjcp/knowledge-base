# What is Alchemist?

Alchemist was started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thegostep/status/1358159173440184322?s=20) by [@thegostep](https://twitter.com/thegostep).

There is no “dev team”. There is no company. There is only a community of alchemists figuring out what to build in the open.

There is no roadmap. An alchemist never makes forward-looking statements, simply because the future is unpredictable.

The only plan is there is no plan ⚗️

**How do I become an Alchemist?**

Becoming an alchemist requires learning and practice. Training is a way of life for a true alchemist. There is no final destination, only continuous change.

⚗️ $MIST is used to coordinate and reward committed alchemists. Whether you are an artist, a developer, a community manager, or a liquidity provider, there is a role for you.

Come meet the other alchemists at [discord.alchemist.wtf](http://discord.alchemist.wtf) and offer your skills in the \#bounties channel.

**Is there a website?**

Not yet. If you are interested in helping build one, check out [the lab](https://discord.gg/UQB4MwG4c8) on Discord.
