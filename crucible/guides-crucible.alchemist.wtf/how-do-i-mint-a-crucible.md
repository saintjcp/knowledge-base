## Minting a Crucible using LP tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important information:** 

Do not use Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail resulting in lost fees. 

We do not recommend using a hardware wallet at this time as many do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When they fix this, we can implement it.

We do not recommend you do this on a mobile

### Step by Step guide
