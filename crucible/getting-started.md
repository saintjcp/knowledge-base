Crucibles' can only be minted from **Uniswap V2** LP Tokens.  
Please make sure you are adding tokens to the V2 pool and not V3.
{% endhint %}

* Some users have reported issues with Trust Wallet. Please express caution when using it.
* We do not recommend you do any of these processes on a mobile device.
