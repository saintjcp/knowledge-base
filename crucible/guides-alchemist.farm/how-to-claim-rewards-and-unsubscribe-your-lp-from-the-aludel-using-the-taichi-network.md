# כיצד לתבוע תגמולים ולהסיר את ההרשמה TaiChi -באמצעות רשת ה Aludel -שלך מ LP  ל

{% hint style="info" %}
The reason for using the TaiChi network is to protect your transaction from being front-run by bots when unsubscribing/claiming rewards.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to [alchemist.farm](https://alchemist.farm)
2. Connect your wallet as usual on normal ethereum network
3. Go to the Crucibles tab
4. Click “Claim Rewards and Unsubscribe LP” 
5. Once you have added the TaiChi network as described [here](https://github.com/Taichi-Network/docs/blob/master/sendPriveteTx_tutorial.md) you will need to make sure MetaMask is using it. To check you should see TaiChi at the top of your MetaMask like so

6. Once you are connected to TaiChi you can now click “Claim Rewards and Unsubscribe LP”
7. Enter the amount of LP you wish to Claim and Unsubscribe then press the blue button ~ “Claim Rewards and Unsubscribe LP”
8. You will now get a pop up box from MetaMask asking you for a “Signature Request” click “sign”
9. Next you will get a transfer funds notification box from MetaMask as shown below. **We suggest you check the Gas Fee by clicking the EDIT button.  Some users have reported this defaulting to the slowest option, which can delay the completion of your transaction. If you are concerned the gas fees are too high, use** [**ethereumprice.org/gas/**](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) **to help decide when the lowest gas fees might occur**

10. The transaction will now be sent to the TaiChi network. You will not be able to see this transaction on Etherscan so don't panic! It will appear there once the transaction has gone through
11. If you want to check that your transaction is going through on TaiChi you can paste the transaction hash into [taichi.network](https://taichi.network/) to see its progress
12. The TaiChi network will be a little slower than the ethereum network
13. Once the transaction has gone through and completed you will need to switch back to the ethereum network to view the Crucible

14. Click refresh and you will now see the Crucible with the LP tokens removed
