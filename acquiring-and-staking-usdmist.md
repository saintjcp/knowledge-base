# Acquiring & Staking $MIST ⚗️

### 1. Getting $MIST ⚗️

Ever traded coins on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to low liquidity on **Uniswap V3**, extra slippage might mean you will not get the best price for your purchase. Please use our **Uniswap V2** link below to perform the token swap.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Swap $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab&use=V2)
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. You should see something like this:

4. Enter the amount of ⚗️ you wish to purchase, ensuring you have an equivalent value of ETH remaining to use for the staking
5. Hit "Swap", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
   * I found that my first two attempts failed, seemingly because they weren't being processed fast enough for the price to remain stable before they finished
   * MetaMask has the ability to let you speed up a transaction by locating it in the "Activity" tab and choosing to pay more gas for higher priority processing
6. Navigate to [https://etherscan.io/address/](https://etherscan.io/address/) to view pending transactions and all tokens associated with your account.
   * if you use MetaMask you can click the triple dots and then "View on Etherscan" to jump to it:

7. You should see your new ⚗️ displayed like the following:

### 2. Staking $MIST ⚗️ to receive LP tokens

Ever provided liquidity on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Crucible only supports the **Uniswap V2** Liquidity Pool.   
Adding liquidity to the **Uniswap V3** pool is not compatible with the Rewards Program.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Add LP to $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab/ETH)
   * Connect MetaMask wallet if not already done so
2. You should see something like this:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/7paIEyF.png)

3. Enter the amounts you want to stake. Both sides need to be equal value, so changing one will change the other. You most likely just want to click the "MAX" button on the ⚗️ side
4. Hit "Stake", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
5. You should see your new LP tokens \(named UNI-V2\) on Etherscan again:
